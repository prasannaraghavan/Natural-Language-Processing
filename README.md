This repository contains my assignments, projects, and notes for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) course offered by deeplearning.ai on Coursera. This course is part of the specialization on Natural Language Processing provided by deeplearning.ai.

## About the Course

Natural Language Processing is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves developing algorithms and models that enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.

In this course, we will explore the foundations of NLP and cover various topics such as text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, language generation, and more. The course provides a hands-on approach, allowing you to implement and apply NLP techniques using popular libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras.

## Course Contents

The course is divided into the following modules:

1. Introduction to NLP and Basic Text Processing
2. Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis
3. Vector Semantics and Word Embeddings
4. Sequence Models and Named Entity Recognition
5. Deep Learning for Sentences and Documents
6. Sequence-to-Sequence Models for Chatbots
7. Question-Answering Models
8. Conversational AI and Language Models

Each module includes video lectures, coding assignments, quizzes, and a final project. The assignments and projects will give you hands-on experience with implementing NLP techniques and applying them to real-world problems.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- `module1`: Contains the assignments, code, and notes for Module 1.
- `module2`: Contains the assignments, code, and notes for Module 2.
- `module3`: Contains the assignments, code, and notes for Module 3.
- ...
- `module8`: Contains the assignments, code, and notes for Module 8.

Each module folder consists of subfolders for assignments, code implementations, and any additional resources or notes relevant to that module.

## Getting Started

To get started with this course, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nlp-course.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired module folder, e.g., `module1`, `module2`, etc.

3. Explore the subfolders within the module folder to find the assignments, code, and additional resources.

4. Complete the assignments, work on the projects, and refer to the provided code and notes to deepen your understanding of NLP concepts.

## Prerequisites

To make the most out of this course, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of machine learning concepts, including neural networks. Familiarity with Python programming language and libraries such as NumPy and TensorFlow/Keras will also be beneficial.
